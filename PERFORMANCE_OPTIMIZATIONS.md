# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Summary of Changes Made:

### 1. Particle System Optimization
- Reduced particle count from 80 to 30 particles
- Reduced FPS limit from 120 to 60
- Simplified interactions (removed heavy push/repulse effects)
- Added respect for user's reduced motion preference
- Reduced particle opacity and size for better performance

### 2. Animation Performance
- Reduced animation durations:
  - fadeIn: 1.4s → 0.6s
  - slideIn: 0.8s → 0.5s
  - transition delays: 0.5s → 0.1s
- Reduced movement distances in animations (100% → 50%)
- Optimized stagger delays in portfolio grid (0.1s → 0.05s)

### 3. Image Optimization
- Added lazy loading to portfolio images
- Reduced image quality from q=80 to q=60 for thumbnails
- Added loading states with skeleton placeholders
- Optimized image sizes and added WebP/AVIF support
- Reduced avatar image size from 600x600 to 400x400

### 4. Next.js Optimizations
- Added image format optimization (WebP, AVIF)
- Enabled SWC minification
- Added package import optimization for framer-motion and lucide-react
- Removed console logs in production

### 5. User Experience Improvements
- Faster hover animations (scale reduced from 1.02 to 1.01)
- Quicker navigation transitions
- Reduced TypeAnimation sequences and increased speed
- Added loading component for better feedback

## Performance Tips:

### For further optimization:
1. **Consider using local images** instead of external URLs for better caching
2. **Implement code splitting** for heavy components
3. **Add service worker** for offline caching
4. **Use React.memo()** for frequently re-rendering components
5. **Consider virtual scrolling** for large lists

### Testing Performance:
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Test on slower devices and networks
- Use Lighthouse for performance audits
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

The portfolio should now load significantly faster and feel more responsive when navigating between pages!
