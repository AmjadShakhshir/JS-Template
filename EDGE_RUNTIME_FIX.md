# Edge Runtime Deployment Fix

## Issues Resolved
1. **Primary:** Fixed the Edge Runtime deployment error: "The Edge Function 'middleware' is referencing unsupported modules"
2. **Secondary:** Fixed Vercel deployment error: "Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`"

## Root Cause
1. **Edge Runtime Error:** The error occurred during deployment when platforms (like Vercel) automatically detected the middleware and tried to run it in Edge Runtime, but Clerk's internal modules were trying to access Node.js-specific APIs that aren't available in Edge Runtime.
2. **Function Runtime Error:** Vercel configuration was incorrectly trying to specify middleware runtime, which should be handled automatically by Next.js framework detection.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Added explicit `NextResponse.next()` returns for better Edge Runtime compatibility
- Improved error handling and return statements
- Made the middleware more explicit about its behavior

### 2. Updated Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)
- Added webpack aliases to prevent problematic Clerk modules from being loaded in Edge Runtime:
  - `@clerk/shared/buildAccountsBaseUrl`: false
  - `#crypto`: false
  - `#safe-node-apis`: false

### 3. Fixed Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Removed explicit middleware runtime configuration (Vercel handles this automatically)
- Added secure CORS headers for API routes (limited to Vercel domains and custom domain)
- Set deployment region preferences
- Restricted HTTP methods to GET, POST, OPTIONS only
- Added credentials support for authenticated requests
- **Fixed:** Removed invalid function runtime configuration that caused deployment error

### 4. Enhanced Next.js Configuration Security
- Added environment-aware CORS configuration in `next.config.mjs`
- Production: Only allows Vercel domains (`https://*.vercel.app`)
- Development: Only allows localhost (`http://localhost:3000`)
- Restricted to essential HTTP methods and headers

### 5. Verified Environment Setup
- Ensured `.env.example` has all required Clerk environment variables
- Added proper error boundaries in the layout for missing Clerk keys

## Key Points
- The middleware now explicitly returns `NextResponse.next()` for better compatibility
- Webpack configuration prevents unsupported Node.js modules from being bundled for client-side/edge usage
- Vercel configuration ensures consistent Edge Runtime behavior
- The solution maintains full Clerk functionality while being deployment-friendly

## Testing
- ✅ Build passes locally with `npm run build`
- ✅ Middleware size: 80.2 kB (within limits)
- ✅ All routes and authentication flows preserved
- ✅ Webhook routes properly excluded from authentication

## Deployment Ready
The application is now ready for deployment to Vercel and other Edge Runtime platforms without the unsupported modules error.
