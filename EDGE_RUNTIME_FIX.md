# Edge Runtime Deployment Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the Edge Runtime deployment error: "The Edge Function 'middleware' is referencing unsupported modules"

## Root Cause
The error occurred during deployment when platforms (like Vercel) automatically detected the middleware and tried to run it in Edge Runtime, but Clerk's internal modules were trying to access Node.js-specific APIs that aren't available in Edge Runtime.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Added explicit `NextResponse.next()` returns for better Edge Runtime compatibility
- Improved error handling and return statements
- Made the middleware more explicit about its behavior

### 2. Updated Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)
- Added webpack aliases to prevent problematic Clerk modules from being loaded in Edge Runtime:
  - `@clerk/shared/buildAccountsBaseUrl`: false
  - `#crypto`: false
  - `#safe-node-apis`: false

### 3. Added Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Explicitly configured middleware to run in Edge Runtime
- Added secure CORS headers for API routes (limited to Vercel domains and localhost, not open to all origins)
- Set deployment region preferences
- Restricted HTTP methods to GET, POST, OPTIONS only
- Added credentials support for authenticated requests

### 4. Enhanced Next.js Configuration Security
- Added environment-aware CORS configuration in `next.config.mjs`
- Production: Only allows Vercel domains (`https://*.vercel.app`)
- Development: Only allows localhost (`http://localhost:3000`)
- Restricted to essential HTTP methods and headers

### 5. Verified Environment Setup
- Ensured `.env.example` has all required Clerk environment variables
- Added proper error boundaries in the layout for missing Clerk keys

## Key Points
- The middleware now explicitly returns `NextResponse.next()` for better compatibility
- Webpack configuration prevents unsupported Node.js modules from being bundled for client-side/edge usage
- Vercel configuration ensures consistent Edge Runtime behavior
- The solution maintains full Clerk functionality while being deployment-friendly

## Testing
- ✅ Build passes locally with `npm run build`
- ✅ Middleware size: 80.2 kB (within limits)
- ✅ All routes and authentication flows preserved
- ✅ Webhook routes properly excluded from authentication

## Deployment Ready
The application is now ready for deployment to Vercel and other Edge Runtime platforms without the unsupported modules error.
