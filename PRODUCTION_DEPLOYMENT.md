# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Review

### ✅ Environment Variables
- [ ] All sensitive keys moved to environment variables
- [ ] `.env.local` never committed to version control
- [ ] `.env.example` created with placeholder values
- [ ] Production environment variables configured in deployment platform

### ✅ Authentication Security
- [ ] Clerk webhook configured to prevent unauthorized registrations
- [ ] Admin email properly configured
- [ ] Middleware protecting admin routes
- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production

### ✅ Database Security
- [ ] Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies enabled
- [ ] Admin email configured for database policies
- [ ] Database connection strings secured
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented

### ✅ Code Quality
- [ ] TypeScript build passes without errors
- [ ] ESLint warnings resolved
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Branded types used for IDs
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Fill in actual values (never commit this file!)
# Edit .env.local with your production credentials
```

### 2. Database Setup
1. Follow `DATABASE_SETUP.md` guide
2. Run schema migration in Supabase
3. Verify RLS policies are active
4. Test admin access

### 3. Authentication Setup
1. Configure Clerk production instance
2. Set up webhook endpoint
3. Test user registration flow
4. Verify admin-only access

### 4. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Test production build locally
npm run build

# Deploy to your platform (Vercel recommended)
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Authentication flow works
- [ ] Admin panel accessible only to admin
- [ ] Database operations function
- [ ] Contact form submissions work
- [ ] Blog CRUD operations work
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable

## Production Environment Variables

Set these in your deployment platform:

```bash
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@email.com

# Supabase Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Optional: Performance
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Only admin email can register successfully
- All other registration attempts are automatically deleted
- Admin routes protected by middleware
- Webhook validates all user creations

### Database
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Admin-only policies for sensitive operations
- Environment-based admin email configuration
- Automatic fallback to localStorage if database unavailable

### Environment
- No secrets in code repository
- All sensitive data in environment variables
- Proper `.gitignore` configuration
- Secure headers and HTTPS in production

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor Supabase usage and performance
- Review Clerk authentication logs
- Check for security updates
- Monitor error rates and performance

### Scaling Considerations
- Database connection pooling
- CDN for static assets
- Image optimization
- Caching strategies
